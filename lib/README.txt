These libraries are here for convenience and can be used in the wpilib\user\java\lib to ensure that the build is performing the same for your configuration.
If your build environment uses the project local lib folder before the wpilib path then there is no need to copy these files.
But if you must guarantee that the build is the same for all users, copy these files!
